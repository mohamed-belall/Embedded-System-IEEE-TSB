The ATmega32 microcontroller, renowned for its versatility and reliability, holds a special place in the hearts of embedded systems enthusiasts. However, mastering its intricacies and harnessing its full potential requires a deep understanding of its peripherals and software ecosystem. That's where this project comes in.

Developed by members of the IEEE Tanta Student Branch, this repository serves as a central repository of knowledge and tools for ATmega32 development. **Our goal is to empower fellow students, hobbyists, and professionals alike to unlock the true potential of the ATmega32 in their projects**.

Within these virtual walls, you'll find meticulously crafted driver libraries for various peripherals commonly found in ATmega32-based systems. **From GPIO and UART to SPI and I2C**, these drivers abstract away the low-level hardware details, allowing you to focus on building higher-level functionality efficiently.

But we don't stop at drivers. We also provide HAL implementations that encapsulate common tasks and routines, **simplifying the process of configuring and utilizing the ATmega32's features**. Whether you're a seasoned embedded developer or a novice enthusiast, our HAL makes interfacing with the microcontroller a breeze.

And of course, what good are drivers and HAL without real-world applications? That's why we've curated a collection of practical projects showcasing ATmega32's capabilities in various domains. From simple LED blinking and sensor interfacing to advanced robotics and IoT applications, our projects offer something for everyone.

So, whether you're looking to kickstart your ATmega32 journey, expand your knowledge, or find inspiration for your next project, you've come to the right place. Join us, the members of the IEEE Tanta Student Branch, as we explore the vast possibilities of embedded development with the ATmega32, and let's embark on this exciting journey together.


## Getting Started

To facilitate easy navigation within the repository, we've organized it into three main sections: **Drivers**, **HAL**, and **Applications**.

### Drivers
The *Drivers* workspace encompasses all peripherals compatible with the ATmega32 microcontroller. Each peripheral is contained within its respective folder, structured to provide comprehensive resources for integration.

- **src**: This folder houses the fundamental peripheral implementations.
- **unit_test**: Here, you'll find unit tests covering all functionalities of the driver.
- **example**: Explore basic operations exemplified by each driver. For instance, within the GPIO peripheral folder, you'll discover a simple LED toggling with button interaction.
- **simulation**: Dive into the simulation of these examples. We utilize Proteus as the simulator, ensuring a robust testing environment.

### HAL
